## Usage

Download `tracker.html` and open it in your browser. Everything saves automatically. To load a stat block, click **Materials ▾** and either drag a file onto the viewer or use **+ Add file…**.

## Design Philosophy

Built for high-level, high-complexity play where strict level-cap assumptions and locked character sheets get in the way. Every field is editable, every section is optional, and nothing requires an external database or account.

## Class Variants

Class-specific variants (Druid with Wild Shape, etc.) are maintained on separate branches.

## Upcoming Features

**Planned**
- Prepared spells — manual spell list folded into the Spell Slots panel, organized by level
- Combat section revamp — Actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions in labelled columns with one-click dice rolls wired to the existing roller
- Class resource blocks — Bardic Inspiration, Channel Divinity, Action Surge, Ki Points, etc. (deferred; tied to class variant system)
