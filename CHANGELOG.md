# Changelog

## v1.5.0 — 2026-02-28

### Attack Dice Roller
- Each custom attack card now has two inline roll buttons: **🎲 [modifier]** (to hit) and **🎲 [dice expression]** (damage)
- Button labels show the actual values at a glance — `🎲 +7` and `🎲 2d6+3` instead of generic labels
- Clicking a button rolls instantly and displays the result inline on the card
- To Hit shows a single total; Damage shows a full breakdown (e.g. `[4+2]+3 = 9 slashing`)
- Results clear automatically when the attack is edited or removed
- **Nat 20**: gold `⚔️ CRITICAL HIT!` toast + card result highlighted in bright gold
- **Nat 1**: red `💀 CRITICAL MISS...` toast + card result highlighted in red
- Powered by `parseDiceExpr()` — regex parser handles `+7`, `1d8+3 fire`, `d4`, and anything in between
- Ported identically to `talent-companion.html`
- Fully offline — pure JS, no external calls

## v1.4.1 — 2026-02-28

### Offline Support
- Cinzel and Inter fonts are now **embedded locally** — the tracker is fully functional with no internet connection (contributed by Spirutural via PR #3)

### Bug Fixes
- `talent-companion.html`: Short Rest rolled-phase modal now guards with an explicit `srPhase === 'rolled'` check, preventing stale renders if the state machine is interrupted mid-flow

## talent-companion v1.0.0 — 2026-02-27

### The Talent's Companion — New File
- New single-file tracker (`talent-companion.html`) on the `talent-companion` branch, tailored to **The Talent** psionic class (MCDM / Matthew Colville)
- Based on `tracker.html` v1.4.0 — all base features preserved
- Storage key: `talent_companion_v1` (separate from main tracker)

### Strain Tracker
- Three strain rows — **Body** (pink), **Mind** (cyan), **Soul** (violet) — each with 8 brain pip slots
- Click a pip to set strain directly; **+/−** buttons for manual adjustment
- Total Strain / Strain Maximum display — **pulses red** when within 2 of maximum, shows ⚠ MAXIMUM REACHED when at limit
- Strain Max and Manifestation Die are click-to-edit inline
- Long rest now resets strain and concentration instead of spell slots

### Psionics Powers System
- **103 powers** hardcoded from The Talent rulebook across 6 schools: Chronopathy, Metamorphosis, Pyrokinesis, Resopathy, Telekinesis, Telepathy
- **Manage Powers** button opens a searchable modal — filter by name or school, check to add powers to your active list
- **Active Powers List** — compact cards showing order, school, manifestation time, concentration status
- Concentration toggle per power — tracked for Manifestation Score calculation

### Manifestation Resolver
- **Manifest** button on any power card opens a step-by-step resolver modal
- Shows Manifestation Score (order + extra concentrating powers)
- Roll the die yourself or let the tracker roll for you
- Color-coded results: 🟢 No strain / 🟡 +1 strain / 🔴 +order strain
- Strain Allocation step — distribute gained strain across Body/Mind/Soul before confirming
- Special warning when strain would exceed maximum — choose to manifest and die, or cancel

### Effects Section (replaces Active Spells)
- **Status** panel renamed to **Effects**
- **Strain Conditions** auto-populate as colored badges based on current strain values (12 threshold conditions across Body/Mind/Soul)
- **Manual Effects** sub-panel replaces Active Spells — same free-text entry, dismissable, works as before

### Formulas Update
- Formulas dropdown now shows **Power Attack** (d20 + INT Mod + Proficiency) and **Power Save DC** (8 + INT Mod + Proficiency) with live calculated values instead of generic Spell Attack/Spell Save DC

### Polish & Fixes
- Lore panel titlebar buttons (minimize/close) now styled correctly — were showing browser-default white background
- Saves section title was permanently showing the Save button due to a `null` key bug — fixed
- Section title chevrons: resolved a double `style` attribute bug that was preventing `justify-content: space-between` from applying; chevrons now sit flush right, matching all other collapsible sections
- Edit pencil button opacity raised from 0.4 → 0.65 for better visibility at rest
